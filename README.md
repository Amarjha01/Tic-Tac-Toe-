# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This simple web-based game allows two players to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in their web browsers.

## Version
Current Version: 1.0.1

# How to Play
1 **Accessing the Game:** You can play the game by accessing the live demo here.

2 **Game Rules:** The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are simple:

**-** Players take turns marking empty squares with their respective symbols (usually X and O).

**-** The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

**-** If all squares are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

3 **Game Controls:** Click on an empty square to place your symbol (X or O) during your turn. The game automatically switches turns between the two players.

4 **Winning the Game:** The game will automatically detect when a player has won and display a congratulatory message. You can then choose to reset the game and play again.
